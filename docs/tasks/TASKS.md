## Per-Task Completion Summaries

- 1.1.1: Reviewed relevant `pi-web-ui`, `pi-agent-core`, and `pi-coding-agent` documentation; captured capabilities/constraints for remote orchestration.
- 1.2.1: Authored `docs/design/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` covering architecture, API/event contracts, data model, control flows, alternatives, testing, and rollout/risks.
- 1.3.1: Produced initial WBS and execution logging structure.
- 1.4.1: Rebased plan to this greenfield repo and inserted explicit bootstrap phase before backend/worker/web implementation.
- 2.1.1: Initialized root npm workspace and TypeScript baseline with package skeletons for `web`, `control-api`, and `worker`; installed dependencies and validated `npm run typecheck` + `npm test`.
- 2.1.2: Added shared ESLint + Vitest configuration, package-level lint/test scripts, `.env.example`, and smoke tests for each package; validated lint/test/typecheck successfully.
- 2.2.1: Added Docker Compose services (Postgres/Redis), root orchestration scripts (`infra:up`, `infra:down`, `dev`), and placeholder `dev` entrypoints for API/worker packages.
- 2.2.2: Verified `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck`; updated Repo Commands with concrete validated commands.
- 2.3.1: Added onboarding READMEs for repo root and all package workspaces with purpose, status, and command usage.
- 2.3.2: Expanded root README with dedicated test instructions, package-scoped test commands, and recommended pre-commit verification order.
- 3.1.1: Added `packages/control-api/openapi/openapi.yaml` with v1 contract definitions for agents, sessions, messages, runs, approvals, and transcript retrieval; validated repository lint/test/typecheck.
- 3.1.2: Implemented Express-based REST handlers with bearer auth, Zod request validation, and in-memory persistence for agents/sessions/runs/approvals/transcripts; added integration tests for auth and end-to-end enqueue/approve flow.
- 3.2.1: Implemented SSE run-event stream endpoint (`GET /v1/runs/:runId/stream`) with in-memory pub/sub and per-run sequence ordering; added integration test verifying ordered stream envelopes.
- 3.2.2: Added run-event replay endpoint (`GET /v1/runs/:runId/events?fromSequence=`) and stream cursor support (`lastSequence`) for SSE reconnect semantics; added integration test coverage for replay/cursor behavior.
- 4.1.1: Implemented worker SDK/RPC execution abstractions (`WorkerRuntime`, `CodingAgentSdkRpcRuntime`) and a `WorkerExecutionEngine` that normalizes runtime events into control-plane envelopes with per-run sequence ordering; added worker tests for normalization, sequencing, runtime error mapping, and RPC delegation; validated full workspace lint/test/typecheck/build.
- 4.1.2: Added `LocalWorkspaceManager` with explicit create/mount/cleanup lifecycle for isolated worker directories, including symlink-based repo mount tracking and error handling for missing/already-mounted workspaces; expanded worker tests to cover lifecycle success and error paths; validated full workspace lint/test/typecheck/build.
